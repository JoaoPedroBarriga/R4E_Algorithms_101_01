EXERCISES – GROUP I - Reading/Writing ; Variables

01. Create an algorithm that reads a person's name and writes "Hello" followed by the person's name.
02. Create an algorithm that, after reading two integers, displays their sum.
03. Create an algorithm that after reading two integers displays their difference.
04. Reading the base and height of a triangle is intended to calculate its area.
05. Make a program that receives a value that is the amount paid, a second value that is the price of the product and returns
    the change to be given.
06. Make a program that receives the value of a kilo of a product and the amount of kilos of the product consumed
    calculating the final amount to be paid.
07. The price of a car is calculated by adding the factory price to the tax price (45% of the price
    ex-factory price) and dealer percentage (28% of ex-factory price). Write an algorithm that reads the name of the
    car and factory price, and write the car name and final price.

EXERCISES – GROUP II - Conditions

08. Write a program that receives 2 values and returns the largest one.
09. Write a program that receives 4 values and returns the smallest one.
10. Write a program that checks if a number is odd.
11. Write a program that receives 3 values that will represent the sides of a triangle and check if the values
    form a triangle and classify this triangle as:
    • Equilateral (3 equal sides);
    • Isosceles (2 equal sides);
    • Scalene (3 different sides).
Note that to form a triangle:
    • None of the sides can be equal to zero;
    • One side cannot be greater than the sum of the other two;
12. Use the IF structure to make a program that returns the name of a product from its code.
    Consider the following codes:
    • 001 - Screw;
    • 002 - Nut;
    • 003 - Nail;
    • For any other code indicate “Not defined”.
13. Redo the previous exercise using the structure IF-CASE === switch.case

EXERCISES – GROUP III - CYCLES
14. Write a program that uses the WHILE structure to read 50 numbers and calculate and display the arithmetic mean
    from them.
15. Redo the exercise using the FOR framework.
16. Given a series of N integer values, create an algorithm that calculates and writes the arithmetic mean of these values.
17. Adapt the previous exercise considering that if the average obtained is greater than 8, 10 must be assigned to the
    average.
18. Given a set of n integers entered by the user, make an algorithm that calculates the average of the
    values greater than 4.

EXERCISES – GROUP IV
19. Create a program that lets you convert a value in hours to seconds and displays the value in seconds.
20. Create a program that lets you convert a value in days to years, weeks, and days.
21. Create a program that lets you convert a value in bytes to bits.
22. Create a program to convert a value in Megabytes to Bytes.
23. Create a program to multiply two numbers without using the multiplication operator.
24. Read N numbers, determine the largest, smallest and average of the N numbers read.
25. Create a function that, given a year, checks whether or not it is a leap year.
26. Write a program that converts a binary value to decimal.
